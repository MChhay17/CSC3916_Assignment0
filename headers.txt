### Description:

This file includes request and response headers from a book search API request. These headers were created when making a request to the `book_search` and `book_id` endpoints. Below is a simple explanation of what each header does:

#### Request Headers Explanation:
- Postman-Token: A unique token that Postman generates each time a request is sent.
- Host: The server that the request is being sent to (generated automatically).
- User-Agent: Identifies the program making the request (in this case, PostmanRuntime/7.43.0).
- Accept: Tells the server that the client can receive any type of response (`*/*`).
- Accept-Encoding: Lists the compression methods the client supports (gzip, deflate, br).
- Connection: Keeps the connection open for more requests if needed (`keep-alive`).

#### Response Headers Explanation:
- Content-Type: Shows that the response is in JSON format and uses UTF-8 encoding.
- Vary: Indicates that the response might change based on `Origin`, `X-Origin`, and `Referer`.
- Content-Encoding: Means the response is compressed with gzip.
- Date: The exact time when the response was sent (`Mon, 03 Feb 2025 03:12:08 GMT`).
- Server: The server that processed the request (ESF, which is likely Google's Edge Server Frontend).
- X-XSS-Protection: This security setting is turned off (`0`), meaning the browser wonâ€™t block XSS attacks.
- X-Frame-Options: Stops the response from being displayed in an iframe (`SAMEORIGIN`).
- X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents the browser from guessing the file type (`nosniff`).
- Alt-Svc: Shows that the server supports HTTP/3 and alternative services for 30 days (`ma=2592000`).
- Transfer-Encoding: Means the response is sent in small chunks instead of all at once.

This file is a useful reference for understanding how the API request and response work. It can help with debugging, learning how APIs communicate, and checking for security settings.
